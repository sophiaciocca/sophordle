# Sophordle

This is a clone of the popular game Wordle, created in React.

* A new solution appears daily, and is consistent across machines.
* The user can use the keyboard *or* the virtual keyboard on screen to input letters.
* Upon submitting (using the ENTER key), letters in the correct spot in the solution will turn green, while letters in the incorrect spot will turn yellow, and letters not in the solution at all will turn gray.
* If the user does not successfully guess the solution by the sixth try, the word will be revealed.
